# Alphabet & Sounds

## Introduction
The English alphabet consists of 26 letters. While the letters are the same as in many other languages, the *pronunciation* can be tricky because English is not a phonetic language—words are not always spoken exactly as they are spelled.

## The Alphabet
**A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z**

### Vowels
There are 5 distinct vowel letters: **A, E, I, O, U**.
However, these letters create many different sounds (e.g., the 'a' in *cat* is different from the 'a' in *car*).

### Consonants
The remaining 21 letters are consonants. 

## Common Pronunciation Pitfalls

### 1. The "Th" Sound
This is one of the hardest sounds for learners.
*   **Unvoiced (soft):** Place your tongue between your teeth and blow air. 
    *   Examples: *Think, Three, Thanks, Thursday*.
*   **Voiced (hard):** Same position, but use your voice box (vibrate).
    *   Examples: *The, This, That, Those*.

### 2. The Magic "E"
When a word ends with 'e', it is usually silent, but it changes the sound of the previous vowel to make it "long" (it says its own name).
*   *Hat* (short 'a') → *Hate* (long 'a', silent 'e')
*   *Kit* (short 'i') → *Kite* (long 'i', silent 'e')
*   *Hop* (short 'o') → *Hope* (long 'o', silent 'e')

### 3. Silent Letters
English is full of silent letters!
*   **K** in *Knife, Knee, Know* (Silent K before N)
*   **W** in *Write, Wrist, Wrong* (Silent W before R)
*   **H** in *Hour, Honest* (Silent H at the start)

## Summary
Mastering sounds takes practice. Listen to native speakers and don't be afraid to exaggerate the shape of your mouth when practicing sounds like 'Th' or 'R'.

# English Basics

## Personal Pronouns
Pronouns replace names in sentences.
*   **I** (me)
*   **You** (singular and plural)
*   **He** (male)
*   **She** (female)
*   **It** (thing/animal)
*   **We** (us)
*   **They** (them)

## The Verb "To Be"
This is the most important verb in English. It is irregular.

| Subject | Present Form | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I | **am** | I am happy. |
| You | **are** | You are a student. |
| He/She/It | **is** | She is tall. |
| We | **are** | We are friends. |
| They | **are** | They are here. |

## Articles: A, An, The

### Indefinite Articles: A / An
Used for singular, countable nouns when we mention them for the first time or generally.
*   Use **A** before consonant sounds: *A car, A house, A university* (starts with 'y' sound).
*   Use **An** before vowel sounds: *An apple, An elephant, An hour* (h is silent).

### Definite Article: The
Used for specific items that both the speaker and listener know about.
*   *The sun* (there is only one).
*   *The book on the table* (a specific book).

## Basic Sentence Structure
English usually follows the **SVO** order:
**Subject + Verb + Object**
*   *John (S) eats (V) an apple (O).*
*   *I (S) love (V) English (O).*

  "Present Simple": `
# Present Simple

## When to use it
1.  **Habits & Routines**: Actions we do regularly.
    *   *I wake up at 7 AM.*
2.  **Facts & General Truths**: Things that are always true.
    *   *The sun rises in the east.*
    *   *Water boils at 100 degrees.*
3.  **Permanent Situations**: 
    *   *I live in London.*

## The Rules

### Positive Sentences
*   I / You / We / They + **Verb** (base form)
*   He / She / It + **Verb + s/es**

*Examples:*
*   *I **play** tennis.*
*   *She **plays** tennis.* (Note the 's')

### Negative Sentences
Use **do not (don't)** or **does not (doesn't)**.
*   I / You / We / They + **don't** + Verb
*   He / She / It + **doesn't** + Verb

*Examples:*
*   *We **don't** like coffee.*
*   *He **doesn't** work here.* (Note: main verb loses the 's')

### Questions
Use **Do** or **Does**.
*   **Do** + I / you / we / they + Verb?
*   **Does** + he / she / it + Verb?

*Examples:*
*   ***Do** you speak English?*
*   ***Does** she play piano?*

## Spelling Rules for He/She/It
1.  Most verbs: add **-s** (*walk → walks*).
2.  Ending in -ch, -sh, -s, -x, -o: add **-es** (*watch → watches, go → goes*).
3.  Ending in consonant + y: change y to **-ies** (*study → studies*).

  "Present Continuous": `
# Present Continuous

## When to use it
1.  **Actions happening NOW**: Right at this moment.

2.  **Temporary situations**: Happening around now, but not permanent.
    *   *I am staying at a hotel this week.*
3.  **Future arrangements**: Fixed plans.
    *   *I am meeting John tomorrow.*

## The Formula
**Subject + am/is/are + Verb-ing**

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I | **am** | working |
| He / She / It | **is** | working |
| You / We / They | **are** | working |

## Spelling Rules for -ing
1.  Most verbs: add **-ing** (*work → working*).
2.  Ending in -e: remove 'e' + **-ing** (*make → making*).
3.  Ending in 1 vowel + 1 consonant: double the consonant (*run → running, sit → sitting*).

## Stative Verbs (Non-Action)
Some verbs describe states, not actions, and are **NOT** usually used in the continuous form.
*   *Like, love, hate, want, need, know, believe, understand.*
*   **Correct:** *I want a coffee.*
*   **Incorrect:** *I am wanting a coffee.*

These do not follow rules. You must memorize them.

## Negatives & Questions

*   *I **didn't go** to work.* (NOT: I didn't went)
*   *She **didn't watch** TV.*

### Questions
**Did + Subject + Base Verb?**
*   ***Did** you **call** him?*

*   **Hedged**: *It **seems** that this idea **might** have some drawbacks.*
*   **Hedged**: *I **would argue** that we **could** look at other options.*
